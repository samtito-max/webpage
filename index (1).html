        <h2>About Us</h2>
       <b> History and the Theoretical Foundation of Montessori Education.</b>
       <br>
The Montessori method, developed by Dr. Maria Montessori in the early 1900s, was based on scientific observation of children's natural learning processes. The approach focuses on hands-on learning led by the child, with teachers and specially designed materials within a prepared environment that promotes independence, respect, and love for learning.
<br>
<br>
<b>How Montessori Aligns with Whole Child Development</b>
<br>
Montessori education cultivates cognitive, social, emotional, and physical growth. It educates children on developing critical thinking, self-discipline, and a lifelong love for learning by respecting their individuality to make choices through an exploratory environment.
<br>
<br>
<b>Why Choose Montessori for Your Child?</b>
<br>
 We chose the Montessori model because it caters to the unique needs of the early learner through individual learning plans, specialized materials, and a focus on self-directed activity. We want to provide an environment where the children will feel valued and in control of their learning.
